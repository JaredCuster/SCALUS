# prelaunch

prelaunch is a simple binary that takes the place of scalus.exe on Windows and displays a splash screen
while SCALUS loads. scalus.exe is renamed to _scalus.exe. Because this is intended to load quickly it 
is based on .NET Framework 4.6 and the binaries are simply checked in to git and included in the 
Windows installer.
